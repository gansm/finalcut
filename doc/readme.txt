                            The Final Cut 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Final Cut is a C++ class library and widget toolkit with full mouse
support for creating a text-based user interface. The library supports
the programmer to develop an application for the text console. It allows
the simultaneous handling of multiple text windows on the screen.

The structure of the Qt framework was originally the inspiration for
the C++ class design of FINAL CUT. It provides common controls like
dialog boxes, push buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, input lines,
list boxes, status bars and so on.

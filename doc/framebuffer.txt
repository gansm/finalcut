Framebuffer
===========

The Final Cut determines the used number of bits per pixel (bpp) 
for Linux framebuffer console to determine whether 16 (or more) 
different background colors can be displayed. Therefore your user
needs read-access to the framebuffer device (/dev/fb0 or /dev/fb/0).
You can check this with the following command:

> fbset -i

If the read-access is not given, it can help to add your user to 
the group "video". To do this, please enter the following command:

> sudo usermod -a -G video USERNAME

You can check the group members with the id command:

> id
